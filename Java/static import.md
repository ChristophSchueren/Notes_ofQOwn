static import
=============

`import static java.lang.Math.*;`

Once the static members have been imported, they may be used without qualification:
`double r = cos(PI * theta);`

The static import declaration is analogous to the normal import declaration. Where the normal import declaration imports classes from packages, allowing them to be used without package qualification, the static import declaration imports static members from classes, allowing them to be used without class qualification.
