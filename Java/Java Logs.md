**Logback Project**
Logback is intended as a successor to the popular *log4j* project, picking up where log4j leaves off.

*logback-beagle:* an *Eclipse* plug-in for viewing logs
We also offer a console plugin for Eclipse called logback-beagle. It allows you to receive logging events in a convenient Eclipse view, and offers various convenient features. A more precise description for this plug-in along with installation instructions can be found in logback-beagle user guide.

**Lilith**
Lilith is a logging and access event viewer for logback. It is comparable to log4j's *chainsaw*, except that Lilith is designed to handle large amounts of logging data without flinching.
