3 Versions
==========

So, for a given file, there are possibly **three separate copies whilst working on it.** 

1. There's the previous version that was committed (i.e. HEAD)
2. there's the current version on disk (the working tree)
3.  and a third copy, which is a *cached version in the index*. 


That's why, when you have a local change combined with one that already exists you might see the same file twice in the status message:
